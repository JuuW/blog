			<strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute
			English. I'm Catherine&hellip;<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Li<br /></strong>&hellip;and I'm Li. And today we are
			talking about women's rights. Catherine, do you think women's rights
			are well covered by the media?<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Catherine<br /></strong><strong>Covered</strong> means
			'talked about'. And I would say it could be better, to be honest.
			Many women's magazines are all about beauty tips, fashion and how to
			please your man. Now, I'm interested in the real issues. One thing
			the media doesn't talk about much is what the role of childless
			women, like myself, is. And <strong>childless</strong> means 'having
			no children'.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes. In some societies, the <strong>role</strong>
			of women &ndash; role, the way they are expected to behave
			&ndash;&nbsp;is to have children. If they don't, it's like there's
			something wrong with them, and they are supposed to be unhappy.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I have no children and I'm very
			happy. Anyway, women in various countries around the world want to
			discuss problems which are close to home. And that's why the BBC has
			organised a series of programmes to discuss some issues that affect
			half the world's population. The series is called 100 Women and it's
			the theme of this 6 Minute English.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Li<br /></strong>The <strong>discrimination</strong> against
			women happens in different ways in different countries.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Discrimination means the unjust
			treatment of people who belong to different groups - in this case,
			male and female. Maybe Li, more women should be in positions of
			power. And that's what today's quiz question is about. Li, how many
			female heads of state or government do we have around the world now,
			in 2015? Is it:&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			a)&nbsp;9<br />b)&nbsp;19 or<br />c)&nbsp;29
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Li<br /></span></strong><span
				data-mce-mark="1">Well, I'm going to guess&hhellip; c) 29. </span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's very optimistic and we'll
			find out later if you're right. Now, let's talk about the BBC's 100
			Women season. The season will include programmes across all the BBC
			platforms &ndash; including radio, online, TV and social media. And
			the BBC's Tammi Walker is working on the social media offer. Here she
			is, explaining what audiences can expect.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br />
			<strong><span>Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer
					for 100 Women<br />
			</span></strong><span>Within the season we've got big debates. One is "Is news
				failing women?", which is obviously <strong>at the core</strong> of
				what we are trying to get to. And that will be a live debate held in
				London but we're going to have people speaking in different
				countries about that. And we're also doing a big debate called "What
				does it mean to be a good girl or an ideal woman?". December the 1<sup>st</sup>
				we have three topics - leadership, relationships and image - and
				we're going to do three live debates on that day. And we've sent out
				packs to over 100 women's groups around the world, so that on the
				day they all get involved.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span>Li<br /></span></strong><span>So at the core of
				the project 100 Women there will be live debates. By the way, the
				word 'core' means 'the central part of it'.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Indeed. And as you know Li, in some
			countries, women face some fairly basic problems&hellip; Here's&nbsp;<strong>Tammi
				Walker</strong> again. And this time, what word means, well, you know, what
			you do when you go to the toilet?
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">INSERT</span></strong><br />
			<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Tammi Walker, BBC
					social media producer for 100 Women<br />
			</span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">We are tying in with World Toilet Day,
				with the right to <strong>pee</strong>. For example in India, women
				are charged 25 rupees to go to the toilet whereas men obviously can
				go anywhere for free. You don't have to pay to go!
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span>Li<br /></span></strong><span>Yes. Women in
				India have to pay to pee &ndash; it means to urinate, to pass water
				&ndash; while men can go anywhere. It is a matter of public health
				too. </span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Most
				definitely. Now, this is the third BBC 100 Women season. Last time
				it prompted a big discussion in Iran. Let's hear what Sanam
				Dolatshahi has to say. She's a producer from BBC Persian. And can
				you understand what the word <strong>sexism</strong> means?
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span><strong>INSERT<br /></strong><strong>Sanam
					Dolatshahi, producer,&nbsp;BBC Persian<br />
			</strong></span><span>Many people are familiar with other 'isms' you know
				&ndash; for example, racism. When you say 'racism' people know what
				it means in Iran. But not necessarily sexism. Many people confused
				it with sex. So some people were asking us: Air your programmes
				about sexism after the watershed, after 9 pm, you know, so that the
				children will not watch. </span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Li<br /></strong>Sexism means to have a very strict idea of
			what each sex can or can't do and it is a form of prejudice.
			Sometimes people are prejudiced and they don't even know it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Catherine<br /></span></strong><span
				data-mce-mark="1">Absolutely. But this prejudice, whether
				known or unknown, can bring a lot of suffering. Well, there's a lot
				more we could say about women in our society but we are running out
				of time. So let's get back to our quiz question Li&hellip;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span>Li<br /></span></strong><span>Yeah. You asked
				me about women in powerful positions&hellip;<br />
			<br />
			</span><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>That's
				right. I asked you: How many heads of state or government do we have
				around the world now, in 2015? Is it:</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>a)</span>&nbsp;<span>9<br /></span><span>b)</span>&nbsp;<span>19
				or<br />
			</span><span>c)</span>&nbsp;<span>29</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><span>Li<br /></span></strong><span>And I said c) 29.<br />
			<br /></span><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Unfortunately
				Li, it's wrong! The correct answer is b) 19. And according to a 2015
				United Nations report, in 1995 there were only 12 female heads of
				state or government but now there are 19. And before you go let me
				remind you of some of the key words we've used today. They were:</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>covered<br /></span><span>childless<br /></span><span>role<br /></span><span>discrimination
				<br />
			</span><span>at the core<br /></span><span>pee<br /></span><span>sexism<br />
			<br /></span><strong><span>Li<br /></span></strong><span>Well, that
				just about brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We
				would like to invite you to follow the BBC 100 Women season in
				English or your own language. Men are invited too. </span>
		</p>
